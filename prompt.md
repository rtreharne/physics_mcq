You are helping me build PhysicsMCQ.org — a web app for A-level Physics revision. I want to generate large batches of high-quality, unique multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering all UK exam board specifications (AQA, OCR A/B, Edexcel, Eduqas, WJEC, CCEA).

Each question should be:

- Categorised by a **main topic** and **sub-topic** from my unified topic list (78 sub-topics total).
- Tagged with relevant **keywords** (terms, formulas, concepts).
- Marked with applicable **exam_boards** (e.g., AQA;OCR;Edexcel).
- Contain **no diagrams** — everything must be self-contained, text-only.
- Include 4 answer options (A–D), with only one correct answer.
- Include a **clear explanation** for the correct answer.
- Assigned a **difficulty level**: easy, medium, hard, or hardcore.
- Uniquely worded — no copying past paper content, even if paraphrased.
- A mix of **numerical and conceptual** questions.

Please output the results in this format (CSV-style columns):

`topic, subtopic, keywords, exam_boards, question_text, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, correct_option, explanation, difficulty`

Start by generating **30 questions** for the topic:

**Mechanics → 2.2 Kinematics**.

After that, I’ll ask you to generate more by sub-topic.

Let’s build something brilliant.
