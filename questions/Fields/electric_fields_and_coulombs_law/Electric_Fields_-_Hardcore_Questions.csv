Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric field; Coulomb's Law; point charges; field strength; force,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,"Two point charges, +3.0 μC and –2.0 μC, are placed 0.20 m apart in vacuum. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force on the +3.0 μC charge.","1.35 N, attractive","1.35 N, repulsive","2.70 N, attractive","2.70 N, repulsive",A,"Use Coulomb’s Law: F = k|q₁q₂|/r² = (8.99×10⁹)(3.0×10⁻⁶)(2.0×10⁻⁶)/(0.20)² = 1.35 N. Opposite charges attract, so force is attractive.",hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric field; test charge; resultant field,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,Two equal charges of +5.0 μC are placed 0.30 m apart. What is the electric field strength at the midpoint between them?,0 N/C,1.00×10⁵ N/C,2.00×10⁵ N/C,4.99×10⁵ N/C,A,"At midpoint, fields from both charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Thus, E_net = 0 N/C (fields cancel).",hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric field; work done; energy,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,How much work is done in moving a +2.0 μC charge through 5.0 cm along a uniform electric field of strength 1.5×10⁴ N/C?,0.75 J,1.5 J,3.0 J,0.15 J,A,W = qEd = (2.0×10⁻⁶ C)(1.5×10⁴ N/C)(0.050 m) = 0.75 J.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric field; resultant field; vectors,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,"Two charges, +2.0 μC and +2.0 μC, are placed 0.10 m apart. What is the electric field at a point 0.10 m to the right of the second charge, along the line joining them?",0 N/C,1.8×10⁶ N/C to the left,3.6×10⁶ N/C to the right,4.5×10⁶ N/C to the left,B,Field from each charge: E = kq/r². From charge A (0.20 m away): E₁ = 8.99e9×2e-6/(0.2²) ≈ 4.5e5 N/C right. From charge B (0.10 m away): E₂ = 8.99e9×2e-6/(0.1²) ≈ 1.8e6 N/C left. Net field = 1.35e6 N/C left.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric potential; energy; point charge,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,What is the electric potential energy of a –1.0 μC charge placed 0.50 m from a +4.0 μC charge in vacuum?,–0.072 J,–0.036 J,0.036 J,0.072 J,A,U = kq₁q₂/r = (8.99e9)(–1.0e–6)(4.0e–6)/0.50 = –0.072 J. Negative because the charges are opposite and attract.,hardcore
