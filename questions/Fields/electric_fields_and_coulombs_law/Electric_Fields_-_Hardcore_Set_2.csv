Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric force; Coulomb's Law; magnitude and direction,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,"Two point charges, +4.0 μC and –3.0 μC, are placed 25 cm apart. What is the magnitude and direction of the force on the +4.0 μC charge?","1.73 N, attractive","1.73 N, repulsive","3.45 N, attractive","0.86 N, repulsive",A,"Use Coulomb’s Law: F = k|q₁q₂|/r² = (8.99e9)(4.0e-6)(3.0e-6)/(0.25)² ≈ 1.73 N. Opposite charges attract, so the force is attractive.",hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric field; point charge; magnitude,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,What is the electric field strength 12 cm from a +6.0 μC point charge in vacuum?,1.9e+06 N/C,3.7e+06 N/C,7.5e+06 N/C,5.6e+06 N/C,B,E = kq/r² = (8.99e9)(6.0e-6)/(0.12)² ≈ 3.7e+06 N/C.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric potential; work done; energy transfer,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,How much work is done in moving a +1.5 μC charge through a potential difference of 1200 V?,0.00 J,0.00 J,0.00 J,0.50 J,A,W = qV = (1.5e-6 C)(1200 V) = 0.00 J.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,electric potential energy; point charges,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,Calculate the electric potential energy of a +2.0 μC and a –5.0 μC charge separated by 30 cm.,-0.30 J,-0.15 J,0.30 J,-0.80 J,A,U = kq₁q₂/r = (8.99e9)(2.0e-6)(-5.0e-6)/0.30 = -0.30 J (negative because attractive).,hardcore
Fields,Electric Fields and Coulomb’s Law,resultant electric field; vector addition; perpendicular fields,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,"Two +3.0 μC charges are placed 10 cm from a point, one directly north and one directly east. What is the magnitude of the resultant electric field at the point?",3.81e+06 N/C,1.91e+06 N/C,5.72e+06 N/C,7.63e+06 N/C,A,"Each field E = kq/r² = (8.99e9)(3.0e-6)/(0.1²) ≈ 2.70e+06 N/C. Since they are perpendicular, E_total = √(E² + E²) = E√2 ≈ 3.81e+06 N/C.",hardcore
