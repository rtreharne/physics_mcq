Fields,Electric Potential,electric potential; point charge; scalar field,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,What is the electric potential at a point 0.20 m from a +5.0 μC point charge in vacuum?,2.25e+05 V,4.50e+05 V,1.12e+05 V,2.26e+05 V,A,V = kq/r = (8.99e9)(5.0e-6)/0.20 = 2.25e+05 V.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Potential,work done; potential difference; energy change,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,A +2.0 μC charge moves from 500 V to 100 V. How much work is done by the electric field?,-8.00e-04 J,8.00e-04 J,8.00e-04 J,2.00e-04 J,A,W = qΔV = (2.0e-6)(100 - 500) = -8.00e-04 J. Negative value means energy is released by the field.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Potential,electric potential energy; potential; charge,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,A +3.5 μC charge is placed at a point with electric potential –750 V. What is its electric potential energy?,-2.63e-03 J,2.63e-03 J,-1.31e-03 J,-3.63e-03 J,A,U = qV = (3.5e-6)(-750) = -2.63e-03 J. A positive charge in a negative potential has negative potential energy.,hardcore
Fields,Electric Potential,electric potential; superposition; multiple charges,AQA;OCR;Eduqas;Edexcel,"Two charges, +4.0 μC at 0.10 m and –3.0 μC at 0.30 m from a point. What is the net electric potential at that point?",2.70e+05 V,2.71e+05 V,2.69e+05 V,-2.70e+05 V,A,V_total = kq₁/r₁ + kq₂/r₂ = (8.99e9)[4.0e-6/0.10 + (-3.0e-6)/0.30] ≈ 2.70e+05 V.,hardcore
