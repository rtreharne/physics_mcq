Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,hubble's law;expansion;universe,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which of the following is a direct consequence of Hubble’s Law?,Galaxies are rotating faster,The universe is expanding,Stars change color with age,Black holes are shrinking,B,"Hubble’s Law shows that galaxies are moving away from us, implying the universe is expanding.",easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,hubble's law;velocity;distance,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What does Hubble’s Law state?,Speed of light is constant,Galaxies move at random speeds,Recessional velocity is proportional to distance,All galaxies move toward us,C,"Hubble’s Law: v = H₀ × d, where v is velocity, d is distance, and H₀ is the Hubble constant.",easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,hubble’s law;calculation;recessional velocity,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,"A galaxy is 200 Mpc away. Using Hubble constant H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc, what is its recessional velocity?","14,000 km/s","7,000 km/s","20,000 km/s","17,500 km/s",A,"v = H₀ × d = 70 × 200 = 14,000 km/s",medium
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,redshift;velocity;expansion,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What does a larger redshift indicate about a galaxy?,It is closer to Earth,It is moving toward us,It is moving away faster,It is slowing down,C,Larger redshift implies greater recessional velocity and thus a greater distance.,medium
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,redshift;visible light;spectrum,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which type of light is most affected in redshift observations?,Gamma rays,Microwaves,Ultraviolet,Visible light,D,Redshift is observed in visible light as a shift toward the red (longer wavelength) end of the spectrum.,easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,hubble constant;value;expansion rate,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is the current estimated value of the Hubble constant?,9.8 m/s²,3.0 × 10⁸ m/s,70 km/s/Mpc,6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ Js,C,Hubble’s constant is commonly estimated as ~70 km/s per megaparsec.,easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,redshift;galaxy motion;doppler,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,"If the light from a distant galaxy is redshifted, what does it tell us about the motion of that galaxy?",It is stationary,It is moving toward us,It is rotating rapidly,It is moving away from us,D,Redshift indicates that the object is moving away from the observer.,easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,hubble constant;units;astrophysics,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What unit is used to measure the Hubble constant?,m/s²,Hz,km/s/Mpc,W/m²,C,"The Hubble constant relates velocity (km/s) to distance (Mpc), so its unit is km/s/Mpc.",easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Redshift and Hubble’s Law,hubble’s law;big bang;expansion,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Why does Hubble’s Law support the Big Bang theory?,It proves the universe is contracting,It shows that the universe is infinitely old,It indicates all galaxies were once closer together,It confirms dark matter exists,C,The observation that galaxies are receding implies they were once concentrated in a smaller space — supporting the Big Bang model.,medium
