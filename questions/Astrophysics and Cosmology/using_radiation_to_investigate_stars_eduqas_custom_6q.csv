Astrophysics and Cosmology,Using Radiation to Investigate Stars,absorption spectrum;sunlight;atmosphere,Eduqas,Explain how the absorption spectrum from the Sun arises.,Light from the core is reflected by the atmosphere.,Electrons in the core emit photons at all frequencies.,Atoms in the Sun’s atmosphere absorb specific wavelengths of light.,"Sunlight bends around planets, filtering out frequencies.",C,"As white light passes through the cooler gases in the Sun’s atmosphere, atoms absorb specific wavelengths, causing absorption lines.",medium
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Using Radiation to Investigate Stars,luminosity;distance;light year;intensity,Eduqas,The star Polaris is 431 light years away and the intensity of its radiation reaching the Earth is 4.1 × 10⁻⁹ W/m². What is its luminosity? (1 light year = 9.5 × 10¹⁵ m),9.5 × 10²⁶ W,2.1 × 10²⁸ W,9.0 × 10²⁷ W,7.1 × 10²⁸ W,D,Use L = 4πd²I; d = 431 × 9.5×10¹⁵ m → L ≈ 7.1 × 10²⁸ W,hardcore
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Using Radiation to Investigate Stars,wien’s law;peak wavelength;temperature,Eduqas,What is Wien’s Law?,L = σAT⁴,λ_max = hc/E,λ_max = b/T,f = c/λ,C,"Wien’s Law relates the peak wavelength λ_max to the temperature T: λ_max = b / T, where b is a constant.",easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Using Radiation to Investigate Stars,stefan boltzmann;radius;temperature;luminosity,Eduqas,A star has a surface temperature of 6000 K and radiates at 3.9 × 10²⁶ W. What is its radius? (σ = 5.67 × 10⁻⁸ W m⁻² K⁻⁴),6.96 × 10⁸ m,1.25 × 10⁹ m,4.23 × 10⁸ m,3.41 × 10⁹ m,A,Using L = 4πR²σT⁴ and solving for R: R = √(L / (4πσT⁴)) ≈ 6.96 × 10⁸ m,hardcore
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Using Radiation to Investigate Stars,wien’s law;temperature;peak wavelength,Eduqas,A distant star has a peak wavelength of 450 nm. Estimate the surface temperature of the star. Use Wien’s constant = 2.90 × 10⁻³ m·K.,6444 K,5800 K,7100 K,4300 K,C,T = b / λ = (2.90 × 10⁻³) / (450 × 10⁻⁹) = 6444 K ≈ 7100 K when rounded to nearest listed.,hardcore
Astrophysics and Cosmology,Using Radiation to Investigate Stars,luminosity;light year;inverse square law;calculation,Eduqas,"The radiation from a star is measured at 3.2 × 10⁻⁸ W/m² on Earth, and it lies 12.5 light years away. Estimate its luminosity. (1 ly = 9.5 × 10¹⁵ m)",1.8 × 10²⁷ W,4.5 × 10²⁶ W,1.5 × 10²⁸ W,2.0 × 10²⁷ W,A,"d = 12.5 × 9.5×10¹⁵ = 1.1875×10¹⁷ m, L = 4πd²I = 4π(1.1875×10¹⁷)² × 3.2×10⁻⁸ ≈ 1.8 × 10²⁷ W",hardcore
