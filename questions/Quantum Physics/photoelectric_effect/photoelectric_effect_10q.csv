Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,photoelectric effect;electron emission;light,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is the photoelectric effect?,Emission of photons from electrons,Emission of electrons when light strikes a metal surface,Reflection of electrons from a surface,Scattering of light by electrons,B,The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a metal surface when illuminated by light of sufficient frequency.,easy
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,photoelectric;frequency;ultraviolet,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which type of radiation can cause the photoelectric effect in a metal?,Infrared,Microwave,Visible light,Ultraviolet,D,"Only radiation with photons above a certain threshold energy, like UV, can cause the photoelectric effect.",medium
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,threshold frequency;photoelectric;minimum energy,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is the threshold frequency in the photoelectric effect?,The frequency at which all electrons are ejected,The maximum frequency of emitted photons,The minimum frequency needed to emit electrons,The average frequency of the incident light,C,The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of light needed to eject electrons from a material.,easy
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,intensity;photoelectric;electron emission,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Increasing the intensity of incident light increases the number of emitted electrons if:,The light is coherent,The frequency is above the threshold,The metal is heated,The work function is zero,B,Only light above the threshold frequency can cause emission; increased intensity then increases the rate of emission.,medium
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,frequency;kinetic energy;electrons,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,"In the photoelectric effect, what happens to emitted electrons when light frequency increases?",Their number increases,Their energy increases,They are reflected,They stop being emitted,B,"Higher frequency photons have more energy, so the emitted electrons gain more kinetic energy.",medium
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,particle nature;photoelectric;photon,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which experimental observation supports the particle nature of light?,Diffraction patterns,Photoelectric effect occurs without delay,Reflection and refraction,Interference fringes,B,The immediate emission of electrons suggests that light transfers energy in discrete packets (photons).,medium
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,einstein;photoelectric;quantum theory,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Who explained the photoelectric effect using quantum theory?,Bohr,Planck,Einstein,Newton,C,Einstein proposed that light is quantized and photons transfer energy to electrons to cause emission.,easy
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,photoelectric;no emission;low frequency,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,"If no electrons are emitted from a metal surface, what can you infer?",The metal has zero resistance,The incident light has too low a frequency,The light intensity is very high,The electrons are too massive,B,Electrons are only emitted if the incident lightâ€™s frequency is above the threshold frequency.,medium
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,photoelectric;intensity;threshold frequency,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Why doesn't increasing light intensity below the threshold frequency emit electrons?,Photons are absorbed too slowly,More photons do not increase their energy,Electrons reflect the energy,The metal becomes a superconductor,B,"Photons below the threshold frequency do not have enough energy to overcome the work function, regardless of intensity.",medium
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,work function;minimum energy;photoelectric,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is the work function of a material?,The total energy of emitted electrons,The energy needed to stop electrons,The minimum energy required to free an electron,The energy lost to heat in the metal,C,The work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a material.,easy
