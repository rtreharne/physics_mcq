Dynamics,Newton's Laws;force;acceleration,AQA;OCR;Edexcel;Eduqas,"According to Newton’s Second Law, what is the relationship between force and acceleration?",F = ma²,F = mv,F = ma,F = m/a,C,Newton’s Second Law states that the force on an object equals mass times acceleration: F = ma.,easy
Dynamics,Newton's First Law;inertia;motion,AQA;Edexcel,Which of the following best illustrates Newton’s First Law?,A rocket accelerates in space.,A book remains at rest on a table until pushed.,A car increases its speed when the engine is on.,A person is thrown forward in a braking car.,B,Newton’s First Law describes the tendency of an object to remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by a force.,easy
Dynamics,resultant force;acceleration;free-body diagram,OCR;Eduqas,A 4 kg object experiences a resultant force of 12 N. What is its acceleration?,3 m/s²,48 m/s²,0.33 m/s²,16 m/s²,A,Use F = ma → a = F/m = 12 / 4 = 3 m/s²,easy
Dynamics,mass;weight;gravitational field strength,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,The weight of an object is calculated using which formula?,W = ma,W = mg,W = mv,W = mgh,B,"Weight is the force due to gravity: W = mg, where g is the gravitational field strength.",easy
Dynamics,tension;forces;equilibrium,OCR;Eduqas,A mass hangs stationary from a rope. What is the tension in the rope?,Greater than the weight of the object,Equal to the weight of the object,Less than the weight of the object,Zero,B,"If the object is in equilibrium (not accelerating), the upward tension must equal the downward weight.",easy
Dynamics,friction;drag;air resistance,Edexcel;AQA,What effect does air resistance have on a falling object?,It increases the acceleration,It reduces the weight,It opposes motion and reduces net acceleration,It pulls the object downward faster,C,"Air resistance is a form of drag that opposes the motion of falling objects, reducing their net acceleration.",medium
Dynamics,terminal velocity;balanced forces;falling objects,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What happens to an object when it reaches terminal velocity?,It stops accelerating,It falls upward,Its velocity becomes zero,Its mass increases,A,"At terminal velocity, the downward force of weight is balanced by air resistance, so there is no net force or further acceleration.",medium
Dynamics,inclined plane;component of weight;acceleration,OCR;Eduqas,An object slides down a frictionless ramp inclined at 30°. What is the component of its weight acting down the slope?,mg,mg cos(30°),mg sin(30°),mg tan(30°),C,"On an inclined plane, the component of weight down the slope is mg sin(θ).",medium
Dynamics,Newton's Third Law;interaction pairs,AQA;Edexcel,"According to Newton’s Third Law, if object A exerts a force on object B, then:",Object A exerts no force on B,B exerts a smaller force on A,B exerts an equal and opposite force on A,B moves away with greater acceleration,C,Newton’s Third Law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.,easy
Dynamics,net force;acceleration;motion analysis,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A trolley is pushed with a constant force but its velocity increases. Which statement is correct?,The net force is zero,Friction equals the pushing force,The net force causes acceleration,There is no unbalanced force,C,"Since the velocity increases, there must be a net unbalanced force causing the acceleration.",medium
