Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,stimulated emission;coherence;photons,Eduqas,What characteristic is shared by photons produced through stimulated emission?,Different energy and direction,Same energy but different phase,"Same energy, phase, polarisation, and direction",Different energy but same polarisation,C,"Stimulated emission produces coherent photons with identical energy, phase, polarisation, and direction.",Easy
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,population inversion;laser;electron energy levels,Eduqas,Why is population inversion necessary for laser action?,To absorb more photons,To make stimulated emission more likely than absorption,To reduce the temperature of the medium,To decrease the energy gap between levels,B,"Population inversion ensures more electrons are in the excited state, favoring stimulated emission over absorption.",Medium
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,pumping;energy levels;laser operation,Eduqas,What is the purpose of pumping in a laser system?,To cool the electrons,To absorb the laser light,To promote electrons to higher energy levels,To reduce the photon energy,C,Pumping supplies energy to move electrons to higher energy states to achieve population inversion.,Easy
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,4-level laser system;population inversion,Eduqas,Why is it easier to achieve population inversion in a 4-level laser system compared to a 3-level system?,The energy gap is smaller,The lower laser level is almost empty,Electrons naturally accumulate at level 2,Less energy is required for pumping,B,"In 4-level systems, the lower laser level is almost empty, requiring fewer electrons to achieve inversion.",Medium
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,semiconductor lasers;efficiency;optical fibres,Eduqas,What is an advantage of semiconductor lasers compared to conventional lasers?,Higher power beams,Greater beam focus,Higher efficiency and lower cost,Ability to produce gamma rays,C,"Semiconductor lasers are smaller, cheaper, more efficient, and suitable for applications like optical fibres.",Easy
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,laser structure;amplifying medium;mirrors,Eduqas,What percentage of photons is typically transmitted through the output mirror of a conventional laser?,1%,10%,50%,99%,A,"The output mirror transmits about 1% of the photons, producing the laser beam, while reflecting 99%.",Easy
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,semiconductor lasers;pumping;current,Eduqas,How are electrons pumped in a semiconductor laser?,Using a magnetic field,Using an electrical current,By heating the medium,By mechanical compression,B,Semiconductor lasers use electrical current to pump electrons and achieve population inversion.,Medium
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,2-level system;population inversion,Eduqas,Why can a 2-level system not sustain a population inversion?,Electrons cannot absorb photons,Absorption and stimulated emission are equally likely,Spontaneous emission dominates,Only absorption can occur,B,"In a 2-level system, when NL = NU, absorption and stimulated emission occur equally, preventing inversion.",Hard
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,3-level system;population inversion;efficiency,Eduqas,"In a 3-level laser system, why is a lot of energy required to achieve population inversion?",Because electrons are easily lost to recombination,Because half of the electrons must be pumped to the upper level,Because the energy levels are very close together,Because the transition involves multiple steps,B,"In a 3-level system, at least half the lower level electrons must be pumped to the upper level to achieve inversion.",Hard
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,laser;coherence;stimulated emission,Eduqas,What is meant by the term 'coherent' in the context of laser light?,Photons have different phases,Photons have identical phase and frequency,Photons travel in random directions,Photons are randomly polarized,B,"Coherent light consists of photons with identical phase, frequency, and direction, a property achieved through stimulated emission.",Medium
