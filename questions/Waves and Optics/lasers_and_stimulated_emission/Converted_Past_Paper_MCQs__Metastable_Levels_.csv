Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,metastable energy level;laser;electron states,Eduqas,What is meant by a metastable energy level in a laser system?,An energy level where electrons decay instantly,An energy level where electrons remain longer than usual,An energy level with maximum energy,A forbidden energy level that cannot be populated,B,"A metastable energy level is one where electrons remain for a relatively long time, allowing stimulated emission.",Easy
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,half-life;population;equilibrium number;laser,Eduqas,"A laser’s metastable level is pumped at a rate of 4×10¹⁸ electrons per second. If the half-life of the level is 3.2 ms, what is the approximate equilibrium number of electrons?",9.2×10¹⁵,1.8×10¹⁶,2.5×10¹⁶,3.2×10¹⁶,B,"Using λ = ln(2)/t₁/₂ and A = λN, solve N ≈ 1.8×10¹⁶ electrons at equilibrium.",Hardcore
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,laser;metastable state;half-life;stimulated emission,Eduqas,Why is it desirable for the metastable state in a laser system to have a long half-life?,It reduces the energy needed for pumping,It allows more electrons to undergo spontaneous emission,It increases the chance of stimulated emission,It lowers the laser frequency,C,"A longer half-life means electrons remain longer, increasing the chance they undergo stimulated rather than spontaneous emission.",Medium
