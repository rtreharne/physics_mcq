Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,energy difference;photon energy;laser frequency,Eduqas,"A laser emits light of wavelength 633 nm. What is the energy of a single photon emitted? (h = 6.63×10⁻³⁴ Js, c = 3.00×10⁸ m/s)",3.14×10⁻¹⁹ J,2.94×10⁻¹⁹ J,2.63×10⁻¹⁹ J,3.43×10⁻¹⁹ J,B,E = hc/λ → E = (6.63×10⁻³⁴)(3.00×10⁸)/(633×10⁻⁹) ≈ 2.94×10⁻¹⁹ J.,Hardcore
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,population inversion;energy states;electron distribution,Eduqas,"In a laser medium with 1×10²⁰ atoms, if 7×10¹⁹ atoms are in the excited state, what fraction of atoms contribute to stimulated emission?",0.2,0.3,0.7,0.5,C,Population inversion implies excited/total = 7×10¹⁹ / 1×10²⁰ = 0.7.,Hardcore
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,power;photon energy;photon number,Eduqas,A laser outputs 5 mW of light at 650 nm. How many photons are emitted per second?,1.52×10¹⁶,1.27×10¹⁶,2.54×10¹⁶,9.20×10¹⁵,B,Photon energy E = hc/λ; Number/sec = Power/E ≈ (5×10⁻³) ÷ (3.06×10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 1.63×10¹⁶ photons/s.,Hardcore
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,efficiency;pumping energy;laser output,Eduqas,A laser requires 50 W of electrical input and produces a 5 W laser beam. What is its efficiency?,10%,5%,15%,20%,A,Efficiency = (useful output/input) × 100 = (5/50)×100 = 10%.,Hardcore
Waves and Optics,Lasers and Stimulated Emission,beam divergence;spot size;distance,Eduqas,A laser beam diverges at 1.5 mrad. What will be its spot diameter after traveling 2 km?,2.5 m,3.0 m,4.0 m,6.0 m,B,Spot diameter ≈ divergence × distance = 1.5×10⁻³ × 2000 = 3.0 m.,Hardcore
