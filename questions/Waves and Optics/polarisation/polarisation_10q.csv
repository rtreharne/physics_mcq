Waves and Optics,Polarisation,polarisation;transverse waves;plane of vibration,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is polarisation of a wave?,The change in frequency of a wave,The bending of waves around obstacles,Restriction of wave vibrations to one plane,The increase in wave amplitude,C,Polarisation is the phenomenon where transverse wave vibrations are confined to a single plane.,easy
Waves and Optics,Polarisation,polarisation;wave type;transverse,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which type of wave can be polarised?,Longitudinal,Transverse,Mechanical,Sound,B,"Only transverse waves can be polarised, as their oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation.",medium
