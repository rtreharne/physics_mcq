"In a ripple tank experiment, water waves pass from a deeper to a shallower region. What happens to the wavelength and speed of the waves?",Both wavelength and speed increase,Wavelength increases but speed decreases,Wavelength and speed both decrease,Speed increases but wavelength stays the same,C,"As waves enter shallower water, their speed decreases. Since frequency remains constant, the wavelength also decreases.",easy,ripple tank;refraction;wave speed,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas

A wave on a string has a frequency of 50 Hz and a wavelength of 0.4 m. What is its speed?,20 m/s,25 m/s,10 m/s,200 m/s,A,Speed = frequency × wavelength = 50 × 0.4 = 20 m/s.,easy,wave speed;frequency;wavelength,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas
Which condition must be met for two waves to interfere constructively?,They must be of different frequencies,They must be 180° out of phase,They must have a phase difference of 0 or multiples of 360°,They must be travelling in opposite directions,C,Constructive interference occurs when waves are in phase (0 or multiples of 360°).,medium,interference;constructive;phase difference,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas
Two coherent sources produce interference fringes in a double-slit experiment. What change would increase the fringe spacing?,Increase the distance between the slits,Use a source with shorter wavelength,Decrease the distance from the slits to the screen,Use light of a longer wavelength,D,Fringe spacing \( w = rac{\lambda D}{a} \); increasing λ increases fringe spacing.,medium,double slit;interference;fringe spacing,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas
What is the phase difference between two points separated by half a wavelength?,0°,90°,180°,360°,C,Half a wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of 180°.,medium,phase;wavelength;wave properties,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas
Which of the following is an application of diffraction in everyday life?,Transmission of digital TV signals,Reflection of sound in a concert hall,Operation of a laser pointer,Focus of light by a magnifying glass,A,Diffraction allows TV and radio signals to bend around buildings and hills.,medium,diffraction;TV signal;applications,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas
Why are X-rays not significantly diffracted when passing through slits or gaps of typical size?,They have too high a frequency,Their wavelength is much smaller than the gap,They travel at the speed of light,They are absorbed by most materials,B,Significant diffraction occurs when the gap is similar in size to the wavelength. X-rays have very small wavelengths.,medium,diffraction;X-rays;wavelength,"Waves, Diffraction and Interference",Eduqas
