Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;attenuation;intensity;μ;exponential decay,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which equation describes how the intensity of an X-ray beam decreases as it passes through a material of thickness x?,I = I₀ + μx,I = I₀ / μx,I = I₀e^(−μx),I = I₀μx,C,"This is the exponential attenuation law: I = I₀e^(−μx), where μ is the linear attenuation coefficient and x is the material thickness.",medium
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;linear attenuation coefficient;materials,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What does a high linear attenuation coefficient (μ) indicate about a material’s interaction with X-rays?,The material is transparent to X-rays,X-rays pass through the material unaffected,The material strongly absorbs or scatters X-rays,The X-ray frequency is too low to interact with the material,C,"A high μ means X-rays are significantly absorbed or scattered, reducing transmitted intensity.",easy
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;intensity;contrast;soft tissue;bone,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Why do bones appear lighter than soft tissue on an X-ray image?,Bones emit their own X-rays,Bones have a higher linear attenuation coefficient than soft tissue,Soft tissue reflects more X-rays than bone,Bones have lower density and allow more transmission,B,"Bones absorb more X-rays due to higher density and atomic number, resulting in less transmission and a lighter appearance on the image.",easy

Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;filtration;beam quality;low-energy photons,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Why are low-energy X-ray photons removed from the beam using filtration?,They improve image contrast,They are scattered too easily to be useful,They increase patient dose without improving image quality,They cannot pass through air,C,"Low-energy photons are absorbed in superficial tissues, increasing dose without contributing to image formation.",medium
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;image contrast;voltage;tube potential,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,How does increasing the X-ray tube voltage (kVp) affect image contrast?,Increases contrast by reducing beam penetration,Decreases contrast as more photons pass through all tissues,Eliminates soft tissue imaging,Has no effect on contrast,B,"Higher kVp results in greater beam penetration and less differential absorption, reducing contrast.",hard
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;grid;scatter;radiographic quality,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is the purpose of a grid in X-ray imaging?,To increase scatter radiation reaching the detector,To focus the X-ray beam on a specific area,To reduce scattered radiation and improve image contrast,To increase the intensity of the X-ray beam,C,"Grids absorb scattered photons, enhancing contrast by allowing only primary X-rays to reach the detector.",medium
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;half-value thickness;μ;logarithmic,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is meant by the ‘half-value thickness’ in X-ray attenuation?,Thickness that doubles the X-ray intensity,Thickness that reduces the X-ray intensity to half its original value,Material thickness required for total absorption,Thickness that scatters half the X-rays,B,Half-value thickness is the thickness of material that reduces the X-ray intensity to 50%.,hard
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;dose;inverse square law;distance,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,"According to the inverse square law, how does X-ray intensity change with distance from the source?",It remains constant,It increases with distance,It decreases proportionally to distance,It decreases proportionally to the square of the distance,D,"X-ray intensity follows the inverse square law: I ∝ 1/d², where d is the distance from the source.",easy
Medical Physics,X-rays and Attenuation,x-rays;μ;differential attenuation;diagnostics,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which combination of factors increases differential attenuation in X-ray imaging?,Similar tissue densities and atomic numbers,Higher kVp and uniform μ values,High contrast between tissue types in μ and thickness,Low X-ray intensity and long exposure time,C,"Large differences in μ and thickness lead to stronger differential attenuation, producing higher image contrast.",hardcore
