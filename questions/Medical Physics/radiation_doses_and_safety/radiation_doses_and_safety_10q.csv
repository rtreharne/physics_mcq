Medical Physics,Radiation Doses and Safety,radiation dose;unit;gray,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What is the unit of absorbed radiation dose?,Becquerel,Sievert,Gray,Coulomb,C,"Absorbed dose is measured in grays (Gy), where 1 Gy = 1 J/kg.",easy
Medical Physics,Radiation Doses and Safety,sievert;biological effect;dose equivalent,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,What does the unit sievert (Sv) represent?,Energy absorbed per kg,Number of radioactive decays per second,Biological effect of radiation dose,Ionisation per cmÂ³ of air,C,The sievert accounts for both the energy absorbed and the biological impact of the radiation.,medium
Medical Physics,Radiation Doses and Safety,alpha;internal;hazard;ionisation,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which type of radiation poses the greatest risk if ingested or inhaled?,Alpha,Beta,Gamma,X-rays,A,"Alpha particles cause dense ionisation in a small area, making them highly damaging internally.",medium
Medical Physics,Radiation Doses and Safety,ALARA;principle;radiation safety,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which statement best describes the ALARA principle?,Radiation should always be avoided,Dose should be as low as reasonably achievable,Radiation must be eliminated completely,Patients should avoid all imaging procedures,B,ALARA means keeping radiation exposure to the minimum necessary for medical benefit.,easy
Medical Physics,Radiation Doses and Safety,dose;factors;temperature,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which factor does NOT influence radiation dose received by a patient?,Exposure time,Distance from source,Type of radiation,Ambient temperature,D,"Temperature does not affect radiation dose; time, distance, and radiation type do.",easy
