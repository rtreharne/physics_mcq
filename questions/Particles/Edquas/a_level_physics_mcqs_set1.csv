Mechanics,2.2 Kinematics,displacement-time graph; speed; gradient,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A toy car moves along a track. Which point on its displacement-time graph corresponds to its maximum speed?,Where the graph is steepest,Where the graph is flat,Where the graph curves upward,Where the graph is vertical,A,The speed is the gradient of the displacement-time graph. The steepest gradient indicates the highest speed.,easy
Measurements and Uncertainties,1.1 SI Units and Prefixes,prefix; femto; pico; micro; nano,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Which of the following SI prefixes represents the smallest numerical value?,Micro (μ),Nano (n),Pico (p),Femto (f),D,"Femto means 10^-15, which is smaller than pico (10^-12), nano (10^-9), and micro (10^-6).",easy
Mechanics,"2.5 Work, Energy and Power",braking distance; deceleration; SUVAT,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A car traveling at 13 m/s stops with a braking distance of 14 m. What is the magnitude of the car’s deceleration?,0.46 m/s²,3.7 m/s²,6.0 m/s²,9.4 m/s²,C,Using v² = u² + 2as: 0 = 13² + 2*a*14 → a = -6.04 m/s² ≈ 6.0 m/s²,medium
Thermal Physics,6.1 Temperature and Thermometers,Kelvin; Celsius; temperature conversion,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,The freezing point of ethanol is 159 K. What is this temperature in degrees Celsius?,-432°C,-114°C,114°C,432°C,B,Convert from Kelvin to Celsius using: °C = K - 273 → 159 - 273 = -114°C,easy
Astrophysics and Cosmology,10.3 Redshift and Hubble’s Law,redshift; Hubble constant; galaxies; wavelengths,AQA;OCR;Edexcel,Light from a distant galaxy is redshifted. Which formula gives the Hubble constant H₀ in terms of observed and emitted wavelengths and the galaxy’s distance?,H₀ ≈ c(λ₂ − λ₁) / (dλ₁),H₀ ≈ cλ₁ / (d(λ₂ − λ₁)),H₀ ≈ cλ₂ / (dλ₁),H₀ ≈ cλ₁ / (dλ₂),A,The redshift z = (λ₂ − λ₁)/λ₁ and v = H₀d → H₀ = (c z) / d = c(λ₂ − λ₁)/(λ₁ d),hard
