Particles and Nuclear Structure,Radioactivity and Decay Equations,decay equation;N=N₀e⁻ˡᵗ;exponential decay,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A radioactive sample has a decay constant of 0.005 s⁻¹. How many nuclei remain after 60 seconds from an initial amount of 2.0 × 10⁶ nuclei?,7.3 × 10⁵,1.1 × 10⁶,6.0 × 10⁵,9.0 × 10⁵,A,N = N₀e^(-λt) = 2.0×10⁶ × e^(-0.005×60) ≈ 7.3×10⁵.,hardcore
Particles and Nuclear Structure,Radioactivity and Decay Equations,decay constant;activity;lambda,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A source has an activity of 2500 Bq and contains 5.0 × 10⁶ undecayed nuclei. What is its decay constant?,0.00025 s⁻¹,0.0005 s⁻¹,0.005 s⁻¹,0.0025 s⁻¹,D,λ = A/N = 2500 / (5×10⁶) = 0.0005 = 5 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹.,hardcore
Particles and Nuclear Structure,Radioactivity and Decay Equations,percentage remaining;half-life;calculation,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A sample has a half-life of 5 minutes. What percentage of the original nuclei remains after 20 minutes?,6.25%,12.5%,25%,50%,A,20 min = 4 half-lives → remaining = (1/2)^4 = 6.25%.,hardcore
Particles and Nuclear Structure,Radioactivity and Decay Equations,half-life;activity;calculation,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,The activity of a radioactive source decreases from 1600 Bq to 100 Bq in 30 minutes. Estimate the half-life of the substance.,6 minutes,7.5 minutes,10 minutes,15 minutes,B,1600 → 800 → 400 → 200 → 100 → 4 half-lives → T½ = 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5 minutes.,hardcore
Particles and Nuclear Structure,Radioactivity and Decay Equations,exponential decay;natural logarithm;decay law,Eduqas;AQA;OCR;Edexcel,A sample with a decay constant of 0.001 s⁻¹ initially has 6.0 × 10⁷ nuclei. How long will it take for the number to fall to 2.0 × 10⁷?,693 s,1099 s,1386 s,1654 s,C,N = N₀e⁻ˡᵗ → ln(N/N₀) = -λt → ln(2/6) = -0.001t → t ≈ 1386 s.,hardcore
