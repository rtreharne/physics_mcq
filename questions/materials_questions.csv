Materials,Young modulus;stress;strain,Edexcel;OCR,How is Young’s modulus defined?,Y = strain / stress,Y = force × extension,Y = stress / strain,Y = energy / volume,C,Young’s modulus is the ratio of stress to strain: E = σ / ε.,easy
Materials,elastic limit;deformation;reversibility,AQA;Eduqas,What happens when a material exceeds its elastic limit?,It breaks immediately,It returns to original length when unloaded,It undergoes permanent deformation,It becomes more elastic,C,"Beyond the elastic limit, the material will not return to its original shape—it deforms permanently.",medium
