Quantum Physics,Energy Levels and Spectral Lines,"An electron collides with a hydrogen atom, exciting it to the n=4 level. How many distinct transitions are possible as the electron returns to the ground state?",3,4,5,6,D,"With 4 excited levels (n=4 to n=1), the number of unique transitions is n(n-1)/2 = 4×3/2 = 6.",Exam
Mechanics,"Work, Energy and Power",A spring with spring constant 100 N/m is compressed by 0.20 m. What is the energy stored in the spring?,2.0 J,4.0 J,0.50 J,1.0 J,D,Use E = 0.5 × k × x² = 0.5 × 100 × (0.20)² = 1.0 J.,Exam
Electricity,Resistance and Ohm’s Law,"A wire has resistance 0.50 ohms, length 1.0 m, and cross-sectional area 2.0 × 10⁻⁶ m². What is its resistivity?",1.0 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m,2.0 × 10⁻⁷ Ω·m,1.0 × 10⁻⁷ Ω·m,5.0 × 10⁻⁷ Ω·m,A,Resistivity ρ = R × A / L = 0.5 × 2.0×10⁻⁶ / 1.0 = 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m.,Exam
Waves and Optics,Refraction and Snell’s Law,A ray of light enters a glass block from air at an angle of incidence of 30°. The refractive index of glass is 1.5. What is the angle of refraction?,19.5°,20.0°,45.0°,30.0°,A,Use Snell's Law: sin(r) = sin(i)/n = sin(30°)/1.5 = 0.333... → r ≈ 19.5°.,Exam
