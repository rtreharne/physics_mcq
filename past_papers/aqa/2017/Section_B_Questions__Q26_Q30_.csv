Electricity,Power and Energy Transfer,An electric motor is rated at 120 W. It lifts a 3.0 kg mass vertically by 2.0 m in 1.5 s. What is the efficiency of the motor?,33%,50%,67%,75%,C,Useful power = mgh/t = (3×9.8×2)/1.5 = 39.2 W. Efficiency = (39.2 / 120) × 100 ≈ 67%.,Exam
Waves and Optics,Standing Waves,A string fixed at both ends vibrates at its second harmonic with frequency 200 Hz. What is the frequency of its fundamental mode?,50 Hz,100 Hz,200 Hz,400 Hz,B,"The second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency. So, fundamental = 200 / 2 = 100 Hz.",Exam
Waves and Optics,Standing Waves,A standing wave on a string has 3 nodes and 2 antinodes between the ends. What harmonic is this?,First,Second,Third,Fourth,C,Number of antinodes = harmonic number. 2 antinodes → third harmonic.,Exam
Electricity,Series and Parallel Circuits,Two identical resistors are connected in parallel across a battery. What happens to the total power compared to one resistor alone?,Doubles,Halves,Remains the same,Quadruples,A,"Total resistance halves, current doubles, and power increases to P = V²/R. Power doubles with half the resistance.",Exam
Electricity,IV Characteristics (ohmic/non-ohmic),Which component shows a nonlinear IV characteristic?,Resistor,Thermistor,Metal wire at constant temperature,Fuse (when intact),B,"A thermistor’s resistance decreases with temperature, causing a curved IV graph. It's a non-ohmic component.",Exam
