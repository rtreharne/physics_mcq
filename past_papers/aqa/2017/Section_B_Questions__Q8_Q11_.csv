Electricity,"Charge, Current, and Time","A nitrogen atom forms a N³⁻ ion by gaining 3 electrons. Given the mass of the nitrogen nucleus is approximately 14 u, and each electron has charge −1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C, what is the specific charge of this ion? (1 u = 1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg)",1.80 × 10⁷ C kg⁻¹,1.80 × 10⁻⁷ C kg⁻¹,4.19 × 10⁷ C kg⁻¹,4.19 × 10⁻⁷ C kg⁻¹,D,Specific charge = charge / mass = (3 × 1.6×10⁻¹⁹) / (14 × 1.66×10⁻²⁷) ≈ 4.19 × 10⁻⁷ C kg⁻¹.,Exam
Nuclear and Particle Physics,Radioactivity and Decay Equations,Which of the following best describes the process of beta-plus decay?,"A neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron.","A proton transforms into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino.",A nucleus emits two protons and two neutrons.,"A proton and neutron merge, emitting a neutrino.",B,"Beta-plus decay occurs when a proton transforms into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino.",Exam
Quantum Physics,Photoelectric Effect,"Light of wavelength λ is incident on a metal surface, causing photoelectron emission. The wavelength is halved, but the energy incident per second remains constant. What happens to the photoelectron emission?","Max KE increases, number emitted unchanged","Max KE decreases, number emitted increases","Max KE increases, number emitted decreases","Max KE decreases, number emitted unchanged",C,"Halving the wavelength increases photon energy (E=hc/λ), but reduces the number of photons (fixed total energy), so KE increases but number decreases.",Exam
Quantum Physics,Wave-Particle Duality and de Broglie,"Electrons and protons have the same de Broglie wavelength. If a proton travels at 2.8 × 10⁴ m/s, what is the approximate speed of the electron?",1.5 × 10¹ m/s,2.8 × 10⁴ m/s,1.2 × 10⁶ m/s,5.1 × 10⁷ m/s,C,"To have the same de Broglie wavelength (λ = h/p), lighter electrons must move faster to match the momentum of the heavier proton.",Exam
