Quantum Physics,Energy Levels and Spectral Lines,"An electron in a hydrogen atom is excited to the fourth energy level. As it returns to the ground state, what is the maximum number of distinct photon wavelengths it can emit?",4,6,5,3,B,"With 4 energy levels (n=4 to n=1), the number of unique transitions is 4×3/2 = 6, so 6 distinct photon wavelengths are possible.",Exam
Mechanics,"Work, Energy and Power",A 5.0 kg object is dropped from a height of 2.0 m onto a vertical spring. The spring compresses by 0.10 m before stopping the object. What is the spring constant?,250 N/m,490 N/m,980 N/m,1960 N/m,C,Using energy conservation: mgh = 0.5kx². Solve for k: k = (2 × 5.0 × 9.8 × 2.0) / (0.10)² = 980 N/m.,Exam
Mechanics,"Work, Energy and Power",A 20 N force is applied to an object at an angle of 60 degrees to the horizontal. The object moves 5.0 m horizontally. How much work is done by the force?,50 J,100 J,200 J,150 J,A,Work = force × distance × cos(angle) = 20 × 5.0 × cos(60°) = 20 × 5.0 × 0.5 = 50 J.,Exam
Electricity,Resistance and Ohm’s Law,"A wire has length 2.0 m, cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ m², and resistance 0.20 ohms. What is the resistivity of the wire?",1.0 × 10⁻⁷ ohm m,2.0 × 10⁻⁷ ohm m,4.0 × 10⁻⁷ ohm m,5.0 × 10⁻⁷ ohm m,A,Use the formula ρ = RA/L. ρ = 0.20 × 1.0×10⁻⁶ / 2.0 = 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ ohm m.,Exam
