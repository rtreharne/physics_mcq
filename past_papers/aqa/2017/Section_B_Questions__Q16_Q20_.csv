Mechanics,Momentum and Impulse,A particle travels 1.2 m in 0.60 s and has a momentum of 4.0 × 10⁻² kg·m/s. What is its kinetic energy?,0.067 J,0.080 J,0.13 J,0.33 J,A,Speed = 1.2 / 0.60 = 2.0 m/s. Mass = p / v = 0.04 / 2.0 = 0.02 kg. KE = p² / 2m = (0.04)² / (2 × 0.02) = 0.067 J.,Exam
Fields,Magnetic Fields and Forces,Which of the following best describes the direction of force on a negative charge moving in a magnetic field?,"Zero, because magnetic fields do not act on negative charges",Perpendicular to the velocity and field,In the direction of the field,Opposite to the velocity,B,The magnetic force on a charge is perpendicular to both the velocity and magnetic field direction (F = qvB sinθ).,Exam
Quantum Physics,Einstein’s Photoelectric Equation,"The work function of a metal is 2.0 eV. Light of frequency 1.0 × 10¹⁵ Hz is incident on it. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons? (Use h = 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s, 1 eV = 1.60 × 10⁻¹⁹ J)",1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J,3.3 × 10⁻¹⁹ J,5.0 × 10⁻¹⁹ J,6.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J,B,E = hf = 6.63×10⁻³⁴ × 1.0×10¹⁵ = 6.63×10⁻¹⁹ J. Work function = 2.0 eV = 3.2×10⁻¹⁹ J. KE = 6.63×10⁻¹⁹ − 3.2×10⁻¹⁹ = 3.3×10⁻¹⁹ J.,Exam
Waves and Optics,"Wave Properties (v = fλ, types of waves)",Which wave property differs between red and violet light when both travel in a vacuum?,Frequency,Speed,Amplitude,Wavelength,A,"All light waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum, but red and violet light differ in frequency and wavelength. Frequency is the identifying factor here.",Exam
Waves and Optics,"Wave Properties (v = fλ, types of waves)",A wave travels at 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s and has a frequency of 6.0 × 10¹⁴ Hz. What is its wavelength?,2.0 × 10⁻⁷ m,1.8 × 10⁻⁷ m,5.0 × 10⁻⁷ m,6.0 × 10⁻⁷ m,C,Use λ = v / f = (3.0 × 10⁸) / (6.0 × 10¹⁴) = 5.0 × 10⁻⁷ m.,Exam
