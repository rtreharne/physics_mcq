Mechanics,Scalars and Vectors,vector;scalar;quantities;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,Which of the following is a scalar quantity?,Displacement,Acceleration,Speed,Force,C,"Speed is a scalar quantity as it has magnitude only, whereas the others have both magnitude and direction.",Exam
Mechanics,Scalars and Vectors,scalar;vector;examples;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,Which of the following quantities is correctly classified as a vector?,Distance,Work,Energy,Displacement,D,Displacement is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction.,Exam
Mechanics,Newton’s Laws of Motion,free body diagram;resultant force;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,"A body has four forces acting on it: 41 N right, 25 N left, 20 N up, and 29 N down. What is the magnitude of the resultant force?",16.6 N,25.5 N,35.0 N,50.2 N,A,Resultant = √[(41−25)² + (29−20)²] = √(256 + 81) = √337 ≈ 16.6 N.,Exam
Mechanics,"Kinematics (suvat equations, graphs)",suvat;dimensional analysis;units;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,Which of the following shows that the equation x = ut + ½at² is dimensionally consistent?,L = L/T + L/T²,L = LT + LT²,L = LT⁻¹ + LT⁻²,L = L + L,D,"ut has units of m, and ½at² has units of m, so x = ut + ½at² is dimensionally consistent.",Exam
Mechanics,"Kinematics (suvat equations, graphs)",runway;acceleration;take-off;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,An aircraft accelerates at 3.5 m/s² to a speed of 115 m/s from rest. What is the minimum runway length required?,1889 m,1890 m,1891 m,1892 m,B,Using v² = u² + 2as → s = (115²)/(2×3.5) = 1890 m.,Exam
