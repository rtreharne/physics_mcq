Waves and Optics,"Wave Properties (v = fλ, types of waves)",absorption spectrum;sun;elements;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,How does an absorption spectrum reveal the elements present in the Sun?,Each element emits a unique continuous spectrum,Elements absorb energy at specific frequencies leaving dark lines,Light is reflected from surface atoms creating peaks,The temperature changes the light's intensity,B,"Each element absorbs light at characteristic wavelengths, producing dark absorption lines in the spectrum.",Exam
Waves and Optics,"Wave Properties (v = fλ, types of waves)",luminosity;intensity;light year;distance;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,Polaris is 431 light years away with a radiation intensity of 4.1×10⁻⁹ W/m² at Earth. What is its luminosity?,3.8×10²⁷ W,9.1×10²⁷ W,1.0×10²⁸ W,2.3×10²⁹ W,B,"L = 4πd²I, where d = 431 × 9.5×10¹⁵ m. Plugging in gives ≈ 9.1×10²⁷ W.",Exam
Waves and Optics,"Wave Properties (v = fλ, types of waves)",star;luminosity;temperature;diameter;Stefan-Boltzmann;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,"Given Polaris has a surface temperature of 7250 K and a luminosity of 9.1×10²⁷ W, what is its diameter?",6.4×10⁹ m,8.3×10⁹ m,1.1×10¹⁰ m,1.6×10¹⁰ m,C,Use L = 4πσR²T⁴ → Solve for R then double it to find diameter.,Exam
