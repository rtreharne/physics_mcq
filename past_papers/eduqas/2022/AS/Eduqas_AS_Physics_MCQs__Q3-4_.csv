Mechanics,Newton’s Laws of Motion,force;acceleration;linear air track;graph;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,"In an experiment with a linear air track, what happens to the acceleration of a glider if the hanging mass increases while total mass remains constant?",Acceleration decreases,Acceleration remains unchanged,Acceleration increases,It first increases then decreases,C,"Increasing the hanging mass increases the driving force while keeping total mass constant, so acceleration increases.",Exam
Mechanics,Newton’s Laws of Motion,F=ma;force and acceleration;graph;gradient;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,"In Tracey's experiment, what does the gradient of the force vs. acceleration graph represent?",The weight of the hanging mass,The acceleration of the glider,The total mass of the system,The tension in the string,C,"F = (M + m)a implies gradient = total mass (M + m), where m is the constant slotted mass.",Exam
Mechanics,Newton’s Laws of Motion,acceleration;force removed;air track;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,"After the hanging mass hits the floor, what happens to the glider's acceleration?",It becomes zero,It increases,It continues at the same rate,It becomes constant but not zero,A,"Once the driving force is removed (mass hits the floor), no net force acts on the glider, so acceleration drops to zero.",Exam
Materials,Young Modulus and Stress-Strain,Young modulus;experiment;wire;extension;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,Which setup is best suited for determining the Young modulus of a metal wire?,Stretch a wire and measure load and extension,Drop a ball and measure rebound height,Spin a disc and measure angular velocity,Compress a gas and measure volume change,A,Young modulus is determined using a wire under tension and measuring force and extension.,Exam
Materials,Young Modulus and Stress-Strain,stiffness;Young modulus;metals;ASComponent1Summer2022,Eduqas,Which material from the following list is the stiffest?,Aluminium,Copper,Iron,Steel,D,"Steel has the highest Young modulus value, indicating it is the stiffest material.",Exam
